	<h1 align="center">WASTE MANAGEMENT</h1>
	<p style="font-size:30px;">There are several things you can do for waste management in college:<br>

1. *Reduce*: Encourage the use of reusable items like water bottles, coffee mugs, and containers to minimize single-use plastics.<br>
2. *Reuse*: Set up donation stations for items that are still in good condition but no longer needed, like clothes, books, and electronics.<br>
3. *Recycle*: Provide clearly labeled recycling bins around campus for paper, plastics, glass, and metals.<br>
4. *Compost*: Implement composting programs for food waste in dining halls and other campus facilities.<br>
5. *Educate*: Offer workshops, seminars, or informational campaigns to raise awareness about waste management practices and their importance.<br>
6. *Collaborate*: Partner with local recycling facilities or waste management companies to ensure proper disposal and recycling of waste.<br>
7. *Incentivize*: Create rewards or recognition programs for individuals or departments that excel in waste reductionÂ efforts.</p><br>
